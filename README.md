- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @romanrounkle
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web application penetration testing. 
- This repository has a few Burp Extensions writen in python and some other tools I use in my day to day job. 
- Feel free to modify them in any way you see fit. 
- Only use them on targets you have written permission to test. 
- I'm not reponsible for any negative effects on the website or testing host.
